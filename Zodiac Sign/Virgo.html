		Virgo people tend to be very conscious of details. They may appear nervous or obsess over health issues. They
		are likely to be neat and orderly,
		at least in some area of their life, although they may exhibit the opposite tendency in cases where they have
		not yet found their guiding principle
		of organization.
		</br></br>
		Virgos love work, service to others and the gathering of the fruits of the material world, as symbolized by the
		harvest. They are also likely to
		be a good conversationalist, with wide-ranging knowledge and interesting ideas. They can be analytical and
		perhaps overly fond of detail, with perfectionist tendencies, and they may miss out on the big picture by
		concentrating on the micro. It also benefits them to learn the fine line between discrimination and criticism.
		</br></br>
		Virgos' mission in life is the purification of their activity in pursuit of their goals, manifesting their
		inherent love of excellence in all
		strivings.
