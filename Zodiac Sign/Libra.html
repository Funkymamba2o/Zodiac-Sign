		Libra is the sign of harmony and relationship. The Sun in Libra is at the time of the Equinox, when day equals
		night, and similarly Libra strives
		for balance between polarities.
		</br></br>
		Librans are known for their good taste, elegance and charm. They are seekers of harmony and beauty. Their
		natural mode of living is in partnership
		with others. Intimate relationships are quite important to them, as are issues of social justice. Libras forever
		hope that all parties in a conflict
		will be satisfied, and they have a tendency to understand and support both sides of a dispute, which can drive
		their friends crazy unless they are
		smart enough to value the mediation that Libras naturally provide. Libras will go out of thier way to avoid a
		quarrel, and they may have a hard time
		making a decision.
		</br></br>
		Artistic pursuits of all kinds provide an outlet for Libras' love of beauty. They benefit from strengthening
		their will to act in favor of
		their higher purpose, which ultimately lies in dedicating themselves to humanity at large.
