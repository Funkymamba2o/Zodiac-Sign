		Taureans revel in the pleasures of life. They crave the security and comfort of relaxing in the warmth of their
		home environment.
		They value the senses and the enjoyment of material things. Taureans are likely to work hard to make their home
		an attractive one.
		They also have the makings of a healer and have a large capacity for kindness.
		</br></br>
		Although they are quiet on the surface, almost passive, Taureans possess a powerful will and can be quite
		stubborn at times, and perhaps
		somewhat rigid in their thinking. Taureans also tend to be loving, obedient and loyal. Material rewards seem to
		come easily to them, and
		they are able to lead the good life without being excessively concerned about it. Taureans are practical, and
		provide a purposeful, productive
		and stabilizing influence for themselves and all those around them.
