		Capricorn people are ambitious and practical, and are likely to have an excellent sense of social
		responsibility.
		They also tend to be conscious of social mores, perhaps to the point of over-concern. Their natural caution
		allows them to
		advance slowly and steadily to the top. Capricorn represents the accomplishments of the material and the quest
		for prestige,
		honor and success in public achievement. It is also possible that the driving force behind their ambition
		partially lies in deep-rooted feelings
		of insecurity.
		</br></br>
		Capricorns put themselves under enormous pressure to perform, and can feel personally responsible for those
		around them.
		They may have suffered from a restrictive early environment, and their aloofness may serve to protect them from
		dealing with a fear of
		intimacy, or low self-esteem. Capricorns exemplify the values of hard work and accomplishment, and service to
		the goals of humanity.
		Their redemption comes when they allow the spiritual joy that they feel inside to fully express itself in
		graceful acts of loving-kindness.
