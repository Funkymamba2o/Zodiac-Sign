		Pisceans are friendly and likable, and yet can be very moody and introspective as well. Pisces is a watery sign,
		concerned with subtle emotions and secret mystical depths. Pisceans are not entirely at home in this world.
		They may at times prefer their inner life to this one. Pisceans are dreamy and full of imagination, and are
		easily influenced
		by everything around them, being quite sensitive to the emotions of others. They also have an artistic
		temperament that allows
		them to express these feelings in creative and innovative ways.
		</br></br>
		Pisceans can be strong when necessary, but may have a hard time making a decision. They also may experience
		upsets periodically,
		stemming from their extreme sensitivity as they react to situations and events that seem harsh. At their best
		Pisceans are truly
		compassionate, offering service, love and understanding to all of life.
