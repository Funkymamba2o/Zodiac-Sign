		Leos are likely to express themselves in dramatic, creative and assertive ways. They are also likely to enjoy
		the warmth of the physical Sun.
		Leos have great energy, courage and honesty. They are likely to be self-confident and maybe even a bit
		self-indulgent as they expect to be the
		center of attention, and often are. Leos can be quite determined and usually get their way when they really want
		to. They also possess great
		integrity, and are a natural leader.
		</br></br>
		Leo people are very proud. Their challenge is to temper any tendency for arrogant or egotistical behavior and to
		instead develop humility and
		compassion; to learn detachment in the gift of their affections, so that they radiate their abundant energy
		freely and enhance the life experience
		of others around them.
