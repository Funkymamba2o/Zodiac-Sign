		Cancerians are nurturing and protective of others. Their ruling planet is the Moon, and they tend to be moody,
		with constantly changing emotions.
		Cancerians are also likely to be security-conscious and highly value their home life. They may appear passive,
		and tend to rely on their feelings
		to make decisions. They are subtle, rather than direct, and are likely to reflect the moods of those around
		them.
		</br></br>
		Cancerians may be involved with the past in some way, because the sign of Cancer, the sign of nurturing,
		protecting and sustaining, is strongly
		tied to the past, and the principle of Karma. They tend to collect the residue of past experience and hold onto
		it, allowing it to color present
		activities and lead them to instinctual action.
		</br></br>
		Rather than allowing themselves to be driven by their changing moods, they benefit from shedding the light of
		conscious reason on their habitual
		patterns and focusing on their true goals.
