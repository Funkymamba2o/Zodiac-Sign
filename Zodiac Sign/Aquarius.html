		Aquarians have a rebellious nature, and are eccentric, spontaneous and original. They are forward thinking and
		detached,
		and can seem conservative though they really are not very much so. They are scientifically minded and logical,
		and confident in manner.
		</br></br>
		Aquarians are likely to be years ahead of their time in the way they think. They can also appear to be more
		involved with work than
		with other people, although they truly value social contact.
		</br></br>
		Aquarians are intuitive, imaginative and inventive, and inclined to take chances, especially in the service of
		their goals.
		They can be quite noble in their deepest nature, but also may come across as critical and demanding. Their
		highest purpose is
		found in aligning themselves with the advancement of social and humanitarian ideals.
