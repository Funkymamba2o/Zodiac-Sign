		Scorpio is the most intense sign of the Zodiac, and is associated with sexual activity and with the symbolism of
		death and rebirth.
		Their emotions run deep.
		</br></br>
		Scorpios have great personal magnetism and great powers of persuasion or even the ability to coerce others.
		Their will is strong,
		and they let nothing stand in their way of achieving their goals. They may suffer in life, but their pain leads
		to important personal
		transformation. They are very good at group dynamics, and working with the public.
		</br></br>
		Scorpios are a shrewd judge of other people's motives, and may be willing to use their special knowledge to
		their own advantage.
		Although they can be manipulative at times, when they work out their issues to be more in line with their own
		higher nature, they can
		take on the charismatic power of a natural healer, transforming themselves and society around them.
