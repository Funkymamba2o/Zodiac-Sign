		Aries people tend to be energetic, forceful and outgoing.
		They are good at getting things done, although they prefer starting to finishing.
		Like the energy of the first rush of spring, they move into the world in a headstrong, pioneering way.
		Aries people are likely to rush into things before reflecting, and may also be impatient or unwilling to sit
		back and allow events to mature.
		They have great vitality and a tremendous need to be physically active.
		</br></br>
		Aries people have a strong will, and are self-centered about pursuing it, so that they may try to dominate other
		people until they learn
		to be more subtle about getting their way. They also have an acute need for love and affection. Aries people
		benefit from self-discipline,
		so that they can channel their abundant energy more constructively.
